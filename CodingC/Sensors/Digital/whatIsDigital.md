Digital acts as a boolean with the only outputs it can put out being 1 or 0 (true or false)
Sensors like a button have only two states/values, is it or is it no pressed
This allows for things like loops or safeguards to get out of a loop (while and if loops)
Sensors like the bump, or even the built in buttons on the IED and bot can be used!
